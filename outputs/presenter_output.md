Overall, the jobs found tend to be aspirational matches mainly due to location mismatches and gaps in specific skills relative to the roles. Your solid accounting background and managerial experience align well with the Manager roles, but most opportunities are outside your preferred UK locations and are onsite, which may require relocation or commuting considerations. None of the roles directly highlight your accounting expertise or tax compliance experience, which could be a factor in the skill gaps noted.
