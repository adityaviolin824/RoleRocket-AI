### 2. Manager, TWC Monitoring & Governance - Standard Chartered India (Fit: Weak)
• Why it matches: This role has the exact Manager title and is located in India, matching your preferences. It involves finance-related skills like working capital products and credit approval, which may be a stretch but could be plausible with relevant qualifications. This is a weak match due to your current skill and experience levels.  
• Gaps: Skills are low for this finance-heavy role, experience is below the Chartered Accountant/MBA requirement, location fit is broad but not city-specific, and salary info is unknown.

### 7. Performance Marketing Manager - MELIOR Concepts (Fit: Aspirational)

Overall, these roles mostly align with your Manager preference and preferred locations to some extent but are aspirational or weak matches due to your current experience level and skill gaps, especially in managerial and domain-specific expertise. The Graphic Designer role aligns well with your skills but does not meet your managerial or salary expectations.
