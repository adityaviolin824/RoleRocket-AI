## 1. Campaign Manager (Clean Transportation / Climate)

**Company:** Scion Staffing

**Location:** Washington, DC

**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/campaign-manager-clean-transportation-climate-at-scion-staffing-4322540718?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic

### Improvement Recommendations

Short summary
Taylor — You have a strong, transferable foundation in budgeting, compliance, and financial reporting that can make you a compelling Campaign Manager for a clean-transportation / climate role if you reposition toward campaign operations, policy fluency, and communications. The fastest path is to build campaign-specific skills (advocacy strategy, stakeholder mapping, digital organizing) and produce 1–2 portfolio pieces showing you can run a DC-focused clean-transportation campaign budget, timeline, and mobilization plan.

## Gap analysis
- Role context (from job): Campaign Manager (Clean Transportation / Climate) at Scion Staffing, Washington, DC — onsite. Required_skills / experience_required are unknown in the job JSON (placeholder: unknown).
- Biggest experience gaps between this job and your profile:
  - Direct campaign or advocacy experience: your resume shows accounting experience (Senior Accountant) but no listed campaign, advocacy, or nonprofit policy work.
  - Clean-transportation / climate domain knowledge: no evidence of climate policy or transport subject-matter expertise.
  - Communications, grassroots organizing, and coalition-building signals: your profile lacks examples of running outreach, events, volunteer mobilization, or media work.
  - Location and onsite requirement: job is DC-based; your location is New York and preferred locations are in the UK (you are willing to relocate, which is helpful — make that explicit).
- Strengths you can leverage:
  - 5+ years of financial management, budgeting, and reporting — valuable for campaign budgets, grant management, and performance metrics.
- DSA / coding: Not important. This is an advocacy/campaign management role; technical interviews will focus on strategy, stakeholder engagement, communications, and campaign operations. Data skills (Excel, dashboards) are important; algorithmic coding/DSA is optional and not required.

## Skills to build
Prioritize this blend of policy, organizing, comms, and operational skills:
- Clean transportation & climate policy basics
  - Key topics: EV incentives and infrastructure, public transit funding, transit-oriented development, vehicle emissions policy and federal/state/regulatory levers relevant to DC.
- Campaign strategy & advocacy
  - Message development, target audience segmentation, goal-setting (policy win vs. electoral/mobilization goals), timelines, coalition-building.
- Grassroots & digital organizing tools
  - Platforms: Mailchimp/SendGrid, Action Network, Mobilize, NationBuilder (conceptual familiarity), plus best practices for email/social/digital ads.
- Stakeholder engagement & coalition management
  - Mapping stakeholders (electeds, agencies, NGOs, unions, community orgs), outreach plans, meeting facilitation.
- Fundraising & grant ops basics
  - Writing short donor asks, building a campaign budget, tracking contributions and compliance.
- Data & reporting for campaigns
  - Excel modeling (budgets, donor pipelines), creating a simple KPI dashboard (Google Sheets / Data Studio).
- Communications & media relations
  - Op-eds, press releases, one-pagers, pitch emails to reporters.
- (Optional) Basic GIS / map visualization for routing service or transit impact analyses — a plus but not required.

## Project ideas
Pick 1–2 portfolio projects you can complete in a few weeks to signal fit:

1) DC Clean-Transportation Campaign Plan (recommended, signature piece)
   - Deliverables: 10–12 slide strategy deck + 2-page executive summary + campaign budget spreadsheet.
   - Contents: campaign goal (policy ask), target audiences (3 priority targets), timeline (12 months, milestones), media & digital plan, coalition partners to approach, budget with line items (staff, events, digital ads, outreach), KPIs to track.
   - Why it helps: shows you can translate financial skills into a campaign budget and operational plan for DC specifically.

2) Policy Brief + Financial Case Study: "Cost & Benefits of Expanding EV Charging in DC Neighborhoods"
   - Deliverables: 2-page policy brief + one-page one-sheet for policymakers + short spreadsheet model showing costs and projected benefits (adoption rates, emissions reductions, funding sources).
   - Why it helps: demonstrates policy literacy, ability to do quick financial modeling, and craft concise materials for decision-makers.

3) Mini Digital Mobilization Run (volunteer or simulation)
   - Deliverables: email sequence (3 emails), social calendar (2 weeks), sign-up landing page screenshot or mockup, metrics dashboard template.
   - Execution: run it as a small volunteer outreach (even with a local climate group) or simulate results using benchmark engagement rates.
   - Why it helps: shows you can plan and measure digital outreach and mobilize supporters.

Where to show them: a short portfolio page linked from your resume/LinkedIn that includes the deck, spreadsheets, and 1–2 PDFs.

## Learning plan (4–6 week sprint)
Week 1 — Foundation & positioning
- Read 3–4 short primers about U.S. clean-transportation policy and DC-specific transport priorities (identify common asks: transit funding, EV infrastructure).
- Create a campaign resume headline and write a tailored 2–3 sentence summary for your LinkedIn and resume (see resume tweaks below).
- Start the DC Campaign Plan: outline goals, target audiences, and a 12-month timeline.

Week 2 — Campaign ops & budgeting
- Build the campaign budget spreadsheet for the Campaign Plan (use your accounting strengths to create line items, burn rate, contingency).
- Learn 2 digital-organizing tools at a conceptual level (Action Network, Mailchimp) — follow 1 tutorial each and list the flows you'll use in the campaign deck.
- Draft stakeholder map (list 10 key DC stakeholders: council members, agencies, NGOs).

Week 3 — Policy brief & comms
- Write the 2-page policy brief and one-pager with your financial case study; create simple charts in Excel/Sheets.
- Draft a mock press release and 3 email templates for mobilization (ask, follow-up, event invite).

Week 4 — Run & finalize portfolio
- If possible, volunteer those materials to a local climate nonprofit or ask for feedback from someone in the sector (networking: climate meetups, LinkedIn).
- Finalize the deck, upload all materials to a simple portfolio (Google Drive + a single LinkedIn Featured link).
- Prepare 3 concise interview stories (30–90 seconds each) that use STAR to show: budgeting for a cross-team project, resolving a stakeholder conflict, and leading a time-bound initiative.

(Optional Weeks 5–6) — Outreach & practice
- Reach out to hiring manager/recruiter with a tailored message and link to your portfolio.
- Do 2 mock interviews focused on campaign strategy and stakeholder scenarios.
- If you have time, run the mini digital mobilization with a small mailing list (friends/volunteer lists) and capture simulated results.

## Resume and profile tweaks
- Headline: change from "Certified Accountant" to something role-relevant:
  - Example: "Campaign Manager — Clean Transportation & Climate (Budgeting | Campaign Ops | Stakeholder Engagement)"
- Summary: 2–3 lines that bridge accounting to campaigns:
  - Example bullet: "5+ years managing multi‑million-dollar budgets and financial reporting; now transitioning to climate campaign management to apply operational rigor to clean-transportation advocacy in Washington, DC."
- Experience bullets: translate accounting tasks into campaign-relevant accomplishments:
  - Replace generic lines with quantifiable, transferable phrasing:
    - "Managed annual budgets of $X, implemented reporting processes that reduced month-end close time by Y% — transferable to campaign budget and grant reporting."
    - "Coordinated cross-functional teams (legal, procurement, ops) to meet deadlines for regulatory filings — use this to show stakeholder coordination and compliance management."
- Add a "Relevant Projects & Advocacy" section (even if voluntary or simulated):
  - List the DC Campaign Plan, the EV policy brief, and any volunteer mobilization you completed. Include metrics: budget size, number of stakeholders engaged, emails planned, expected reach.
- Keywords: include role-specific keywords for ATS and recruiters: "campaign management", "clean transportation", "climate advocacy", "coalition building", "budget & grants", "stakeholder engagement", "digital mobilization", "policy brief", "Washington, DC".
- LinkedIn:
  - Add featured portfolio items (deck PDFs, one-pager).
  - Update location and note "open to relocation to Washington, DC — willing to work onsite" in the About section.
  - Start following Scion Staffing, relevant NGOs, and 3–5 DC climate leaders; comment on posts to build visibility.
- Portfolio:
  - One page with: 1) DC Campaign Plan (slide deck), 2) Policy brief + spreadsheet, 3) Sample outreach/email sequence. Each item should include a 1‑sentence context and one measurable takeaway.

Final tradeoffs and quick tips
- Tradeoff: spend more time on a high-quality campaign plan + budget (2–3 full days) rather than trying to complete many small tasks. That single deliverable best leverages your accounting experience and signals campaign readiness.
- Short-term networking matters: a 20–30 minute informational call with someone at a DC climate group will accelerate credibility more than extra coursework.
- Certifications: optional — short nonprofit/fundraising micro-courses can help but are not required before applying.

If you want, I can draft:
- A tight 2-line resume headline and 3–4 bullet points converting one of your accounting accomplishments into campaign-ready language.
- An outline for the 10-slide campaign deck you should produce. Which would you like first?

## 2. Operations Manager - Tax Division

**Company:** Larson Tax Partners LLC

**Location:** Saint Charles, Charles County

**Link:** https://www.adzuna.com/land/ad/5530612146?se=BqwvrGbS8BGpRoq5pupTig&utm_medium=api&utm_source=a2945f71&v=E6B9235D92F6E20815185E449295DB27E576F957

### Improvement Recommendations

Short summary
You’re plausibly a strong baseline candidate (5+ years of accounting, tax compliance experience) but you need to explicitly demonstrate tax‑practice operations, leadership, software/automation chops, and measurable process improvements to be credible for “Operations Manager – Tax Division” at Larson Tax Partners. Focus your immediate work on (1) proving you can run/scale a tax practice (SOPs, KPIs, team processes), (2) showing hands‑on familiarity with tax practice management and tax software, and (3) packaging those outcomes on your resume/LinkedIn with numbers and artifacts.

## Gap analysis
- Role details: required_skills field is unknown in the job JSON, so I inferred expectations for an Operations Manager in a Tax Division (tax practice ops, team leadership, compliance oversight, tax software, process improvement, client service).
- Experience and leadership:
  - You have ~5 years as a Senior Accountant but no explicit manager/ops title or people‑management evidence. The job will expect direct experience running teams or practice workflows.
- Tax practice & domain depth:
  - Your summary lists tax compliance but there is no detail on preparing/managing tax return workflows, multi‑state tax, or client tax engagements at scale.
- Tools & automation signal:
  - top_technical_skills is empty and you list no tax/practice management software (e.g., Lacerte/ProSeries/Drake/Canopy) or data tools (Excel Power Query, Power BI, SQL, Python).
- Certifications & credentials:
  - Headline says “Certified Accountant” but no explicit CPA/EA/Tax credentials are shown. Many firms prefer/require CPA or EA for a manager-level tax role.
- Deliverables & projects:
  - No listed projects, SOPs, dashboards, or process improvements with measurable impact—these are critical signals for an operations role.
- Location & logistics:
  - Job is Saint Charles, Charles County (unknown remote policy). You are in New York and said you’re willing to relocate; make relocation/flexibility explicit.
- DSA / coding:
  - DSA-style algorithmic coding is not important for this role. Instead emphasize process automation, reporting, and scripting (Excel/VBA, Python) that directly improve tax operations.

## Skills to build
Prioritize the following, with practical outcomes you can show:
- Tax practice operations & compliance
  - End-to-end tax engagement lifecycle, multi‑state filing coordination, compliance calendars.
- Leadership & people management
  - Hiring, training, workload balancing, performance metrics, SOP creation.
- Tax software & practice management tools
  - Lacerte, ProSeries, Drake, Canopy, Intuit Practice Management, or equivalent. Even trial accounts and screenshots are useful.
- Process improvement & quality control
  - SOPs, checklists, QC review workflows, issue escalation processes. Familiarity with Lean/Six Sigma basics (DMAIC) is helpful.
- Data/reporting & automation
  - Advanced Excel (Power Query, pivot modeling), Power BI or Tableau dashboards, basic SQL or Python (pandas) for reconciliation/aggregation.
- Client relationship & vendor management
  - Client onboarding flows, billing/engagement letters, external vendor coordination for 3rd‑party data.
- Certifications (if missing)
  - CPA or Enrolled Agent (EA) is highly valuable; if not immediately feasible, list continuing education in tax (e.g., state-specific tax updates, CPE courses).

## Project ideas
Pick 1–2 projects you can finish and show within a few weeks that directly map to the role.

1) Tax Operations Playbook + KPI Dashboard
   - Deliverable: a one‑page operations playbook (SOPs for intake → preparation → review → filing), sample QC checklist, and a Power BI/Excel dashboard that tracks throughput (returns per preparer/week), turnaround times, error rate, and billing realization on a mock or redacted dataset.
   - Why it helps: shows you can design workflows and measure operations—core for an Operations Manager.

2) Automation of a Repetitive Tax Task
   - Deliverable: a short script (Excel VBA or Python notebook) that automates reconciliation between client bookkeeping exports and tax basis schedules, with a before/after time savings estimate and a short screencast demo.
   - Why it helps: demonstrates technical ability to reduce operational bottlenecks and improve accuracy.

3) Client Onboarding & Capacity Planning Pilot
   - Deliverable: create an onboarding template, resource allocation model (simple spreadsheet that projects staffing needs by season), and a Trello/Asana board template for task handoffs. Include sample SLA and escalation matrix.
   - Why it helps: shows you can scale a practice, balance capacity, and improve client experience.

Host artifacts on GitHub/Google Drive and include 1–2 screenshots or a 90‑second video in your portfolio/LinkedIn.

## Learning plan (4 weeks)
Week 1 — Tax operations & role alignment (3–6 hours/day)
- Read a few practice-management guides/articles (search: “tax practice management SOPs”, “tax engagement lifecycle”).
- Map a typical tax engagement workflow from lead → close; draft the playbook skeleton.
- Run quick online demos or trial installations for Lacerte/Canopy/ProSeries to note UI and features.

Week 2 — Tools & quick automation (3–6 hours/day)
- Build the automation prototype: reconcile a sample dataset with Excel Power Query or Python. Timebox: 3–4 days.
- Create sample QC checklist and one SOP (e.g., review and signoff procedure).

Week 3 — Dashboard & metrics (2–4 hours/day)
- Build KPI dashboard in Power BI/Excel using mock or anonymized data.
- Draft capacity planning spreadsheet and onboarding template.
- Record short walkthrough videos (2–3 mins each) for the playbook, automation, and dashboard.

Week 4 — Packaging & outreach (2–4 hours/day)
- Update resume, LinkedIn, and portfolio with quantified bullets and links to artifacts.
- Prepare 5 STAR stories centered on process improvement, leadership, handling high workload, and client escalations.
- Do 2 mock interviews focusing on behavioral ops + one case: scale a tax practice through busy season.

Optional next steps (month+):
- Enroll in an EA prep or CPA review if not already licensed.
- Take a short Power BI or Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt course for credibility.

## Resume and profile tweaks
Make your profile scream “Tax Operations Manager.” Concrete edits:
- Headline: change to “Tax Operations Manager | Tax Compliance & Practice Automation” (or “Senior Accountant — Tax Operations Lead” if not yet manager).
- Summary (1–2 lines): explicitly mention tax practice ops, team leadership, and tools: e.g., “5+ years in tax compliance and financial reporting; experience improving tax workflows, implementing QC processes, and automating reconciliation with Power Query/Python. Seeking Operations Manager — Tax Division.”
- Experience bullets (quantify wherever possible):
  - Add 3–5 bullets under Senior Accountant that highlight operational work: “Designed QC checklist that reduced tax return rework by X%” or “Managed tax filing calendar for Y clients, cut average turnaround from A to B days.”
  - If you haven’t managed people, frame mentorship/training: “Trained 3 junior staff on tax software and review procedures, improving first‑pass accuracy.”
  - Include tax software names and automation tools used (even trial/limited use).
- New section: “Practice Operations Projects”
  - Link to the playbook, dashboard, and automation repo with short captions and outcome/metrics.
- Certifications & education:
  - Put CPA/EA status clearly if you have it. If not, list CPE courses in state tax or planned certification timeline.
- Location & relocation:
  - Add “Willing to relocate to Saint Charles, MD — open to hybrid” in summary or location line.
- LinkedIn & portfolio:
  - Post a short article or post describing your operations playbook and link to the dashboard; recruiters scan LinkedIn for signals.
  - Make artifact screenshots front-and-center on a one‑page portfolio.

Final notes and tradeoffs
- Do not spend time on algorithmic coding/DSA interview prep—this role values operational leadership, tax-domain credibility, and automation that improves throughput.
- Time allocation: prioritize the playbook + dashboard first (best ROI), then automation script, then certifications.
- If you can get even a short managerial or lead title (formal or acting) on your resume within the next 3 months, it materially helps — consider taking on an internal “Tax Process Lead” responsibility now.

If you want, I can draft a tailored resume summary and 3 experience bullets that map your current role to this job posting—send two real accomplishments (even rough numbers) and I’ll convert them into recruiter-ready lines.
